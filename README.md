Small React todo app. The first one I will do in a series of todo apps in an attempt to better understand how everything works in React.

What have I learned with this tutorial:

- State is local memory where all of our data is stored.
- React is called react for a reason. React is all about data, and reacting to changes in data (read state) the UI updates.
- Passing props to children is done by binding functions to component tags. Example being how todos props is being passed to the todo list component.
- How to work with local storage. Saving current state in local storage and also persisting it even when the browser refreshes.

- I can not remember anything else, but I will work on other projects and figure it out.
